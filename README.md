# ReapBenefit.I at TechNgage, Bangalore, May 21, 2016
Reap Benefit builds the next generation of problem solvers by involving students in implementing solutions for local environment and civic problems.  They have worked with dozens of schools reaching many thousands of students through on-the-ground, paper-and-pen, stick-in-the-sand methods.  They are seeing real good traction among students to solve local civic problems and now want to create a platform to scale and reach many million citizens.

_Extracts from the talk._

ReapBenefit started working with GarbageCollection.  But there are more civic problems - air quality, sanitation, lack of water, wastage of resources, etc.  ReapBenefit believes that today's problems are going to be solved by tomorrow's leaders.  

Vibish is a 15 year old student who approached them to solve a problem of water wastage in their school.  ReapBenefit gives him a way to do an audit and measure what is the price being paid: tens of thousands of litres of good water.  Based on the data, ReapBenefit figures out a low cost fixture that can be attached to the taps saving water for the school, the earth, and every one of us indirectly - enough water to keep the school functional for an entire year.  Vibish is now a problem solver.

Toilets are not purely about sanitation.  It's also a matter of human dignity and self-respect.  In India there are about 13 Lakh public schools and 50-60% of them have dysfunctional toilets.  Again, a low cost sanitation project produces multiple benefits for everybody.

Now ReapBenefit wants to reach a Million young people in India in a space of 3 years.  This app is the beginning of helping them reach that audience.  

- *Understand*: Conduct audits that will help identify the core problems.
- *Solve*: With do it yourself kits, pre-solved problem lists, mentoring, etc., young people discover solutions to their problems.
- *Inspire*: Inform others of activities and get parents, teachers, neighbors, etc. to engage and solve problems.  

# Scope for TechNgage Hackathon Round 2
Build a UI prototype of a cross platform mobile app.
- It should have basic UI to indicate what will be the eventual platform.

# Future Scope
- Build entire backend data model for capturing all data.
- Allow multiple levels of views and analytics on activities for students/individuals, parents, teachers
- Integrate with other civic platforms like RTI, BBMP, etc. and others who have promised APIs like BESCOM.
- Have multiple types of user profiles.
